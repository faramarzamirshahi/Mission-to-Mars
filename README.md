UofT - Data analytics - WebScraping

# Overview
She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

# Results
* Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles<br>
* Update the Web App with Mars’s Hemisphere Images and Titles<br>
* Add Bootstrap 3 Components
